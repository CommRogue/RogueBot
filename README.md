# RogueBot
Discord bot capable of playing music from Youtube, Spotify, and Soundcloud, along with other features such as Chess.com intergration, games, weather data, and much more. Designed for my personal usage only. 

To run, edit the bot_config file with the following structure: 
* TOKEN
* VERSION
* IPC PORT
* IPC PASSWORD
* AUDIONODE ADDRESS
* AUDIONODE PORT
... and add API keys for openweathermap found in Weather.py, and for Spotify, found in StY.py. Youtube and Soundcloud are both hthrough web scraping, no API needed.
